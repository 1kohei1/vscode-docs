# Visual Studio Code with Particle Workbench

October 3, 2018 Marc Goodner, [@robotdad](https://twitter.com/robotdad)

We’re excited to announce that Visual Studio Code will be included in the next release of tooling for [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) IoT developers. Developers using the Particle platform can now use Visual Studio Code as their default editor for building IoT apps!

Particle provides a widely-used IoT platform that consists of hardware, software, and connectivity. At their Spectra conference, Particle announced [Particle Workbench](https://www.particle.io/workbench), a new professional IoT developer offering that includes Visual Studio Code.

Particle Workbench and Visual Studio Code provide a free, ready to use experience to develop, program, and debug apps on Particle’s IoT platform, as well as Microsoft Azure.

Particle Workbench and Visual Studio Code are available together through a single, downloadable installer, which includes the toolchains and extensions for Particle’s IoT ecosystem. These include support for local offline compilation and device programming, or cloud compilation and over-the-air (OTA) device programming. IntelliSense for Particle Device APIs are provided by Visual Studio Code language services and the C/C++ extension. Advanced hardware debugging is available in Visual Studio Code, for actions like setting breakpoints and step-through debugging, all pre-configured for Particle hardware. There’s also access to more than 3,000 official and community Particle libraries, enabling more reusability and less typing.

For more information, take a look at Particle’s [announcement on Particle Workbench](www.particle.io/workbench). And if you’re interested about how to use Particle with Microsoft Azure, you can learn how to [create the dashboard of your dreams](https://blog.particle.io/2018/09/28/create-the-dashboard-of-your-dreams-with-particle-electric-io/) in this post from Paul DeCarlo.

Happy Coding!
