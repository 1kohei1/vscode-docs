# Example - Language Server

Language Server is a special kind of extension that powers the editing experience for many languages in VS Code. With Language Servers, you can implement jump-to-definitions, autocomplete, error-checking and many other [language features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/language-support) supported in VS Code.

Historically, to implement language features such as autocomplete and error-checking(diagnostics) in editors, one needs to implement a static analysis tool and then adapt it to multiple editors with different extension API. To solve the problem, Microsoft specifies [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to standardize the communication between the editor and the language server, so a language server can be implemented once and used in multiple editors.

In VS Code, a language server has two parts:

- Language Client: A normal VS Code extension written in JavaScript / TypeScript.
- Language Server: A language analysis tool running in a separate process.

There are two benefits of running the Language Server in a separate process:

- The analysis tool can be implemented in any languages, as long as it can communicate with the Language Client following the Language Server Protocol.
- As language analysis tools are often heavy on CPU and Memory usage, running them in separate process avoids performance cost.

![LSP Illustration](images/example-language-server/lsp-illustration.png)

This guide will teach you how to build a language client / server using our [Node SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node). The remaining document assumes that you are familiar with normal [extension development](/docs/extensions/overview.md) for VS Code.

## Implement your own Language Server

Although Language Servers can be implemented in any language following the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol), this guide will focus on buildilng a language client / server using [vscode-languageserver-node](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node), which takes care of LSP communication and makes it easy to write language client / server in Node.

If you prefer to jump right into the code, here are two sample Language Server extensions that you can study:

- **[lsp-sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/lsp-sample)**: Demos how to write a basic language server.
- **[lsp-multi-server-sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/lsp-multi-server-sample)**: Demos how to write a language server that start a different server instance per workspace folder to handle [multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) feature in VS Code.

The reminder of the document explains the code in **lsp-sample**.

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) and do:

```bash
> cd lsp-sample
> npm install
> npm run compile
> code .
```

The above installs all dependencies and opens one VS Code instances containing both the client and server code.

## Explaining the 'Client'

The workspace contains both the client and server parts. Let's first take a look at `/package.json`, which describes the capabilities of the client. There are three interesting sections:

First look the `activationEvents`:

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:plaintext"
]
```

This section tells VS Code to activate the extension as soon as a plain text file is opened (e.g. a file with the extension `.txt`).

Next look at the `configuration` section:

```json
"configuration": {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Example configuration",
    "properties": {
        "lspSample.maxNumberOfProblems": {
            "type": "number",
            "default": 100,
            "description": "Controls the maximum number of problems produced by the server."
        }
    }
}
```

This section contributes `configuration` settings to VS Code. The example will explain how these settings are sent over to the language server on startup and on every change of the settings.

The actual client code and the corresponding `package.json` is in the `client` folder. The interesting part in the `package.json` adds a dependency to the `vscode` extension host API and the `vscode-languageclient` library:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "vscode": "^1.1.18",
    "vscode-languageclient": "^4.1.4"
}
```

As mentioned, the client is implemented as a normal VS Code extension.

Below is the content of the corresponding extension.ts file:

```typescript
/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
 * Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
'use strict';

import * as path from 'path';

import { workspace, ExtensionContext } from 'vscode';

import {
	LanguageClient, LanguageClientOptions, ServerOptions, TransportKind
} from 'vscode-languageclient';

let client: LanguageClient;

export function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {

	// The server is implemented in node
	let serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('server', 'out', 'server.js'));
	// The debug options for the server
	let debugOptions = { execArgv: ["--nolazy", "--inspect=6009"] };

	// If the extension is launched in debug mode then the debug server options are used
	// Otherwise the run options are used
	let serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
		run : { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc },
		debug: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, options: debugOptions }
	}

	// Options to control the language client
	let clientOptions: LanguageClientOptions = {
		// Register the server for plain text documents
		documentSelector: [{scheme: 'file', language: 'plaintext'}],
		synchronize: {
			// Notify the server about file changes to '.clientrc files contain in the workspace
			fileEvents: workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/.clientrc'),
		}
	}

	// Create the language client and start the client.
	client = new LanguageClient('languageServerExample', 'Language Server Example', serverOptions, clientOptions);

	// Start the client. This will also launch the server
	client.start();
}

export function deactivate(): Thenable<void> {
	if (!client) {
		return undefined;
	}
	return client.stop();
}
```

## Explaining the 'Server'

>**Note:** The 'Server' implementation cloned from the GitHub repository has the final walkthrough implementation. To follow the walkthrough, you can create a new `server.ts` or modify the contents of the cloned version.

In the example, the server is also implemented in TypeScript and executed using Node.js. Since VS Code already ships with a Node.js runtime, there is no need to provide your own, unless you have very specific requirements for the runtime.

The interesting section in the server's `package.json` file is:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "vscode-languageserver": "^4.1.3"
}
```

This pulls in the vscode-languageserver library.

Below is a server implementation that uses the provided simple text document manager which synchronizes text documents by always sending the file's full content from VS Code to the server.

```typescript
/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
 * Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
'use strict';

	createConnection, TextDocuments, TextDocument, Diagnostic, DiagnosticSeverity,
	ProposedFeatures, InitializeParams, DidChangeConfigurationNotification, CompletionItem,
	CompletionItemKind, TextDocumentPositionParams
} from 'vscode-languageserver';

// Create a connection for the server. The connection uses Node's IPC as a transport.
// Also include all preview / proposed LSP features.

	}
	let result = documentSettings.get(resource);
	if (!result) {
		result = connection.workspace.getConfiguration({ scopeUri: resource, section: 'languageServerExample' });
		documentSettings.set(resource, result);
	}
	return result;
}

// Only keep settings for open documents

	}
	return item;
});

// Make the text document manager listen on the connection

// Listen on the connection
connection.listen();
```

## Adding a Simple Validation

To add document validation to the server, we add a listener to the text document manager that gets called whenever the content of a text document changes. It is then up to the server to decide when the best time is to validate a document. In the example implementation, the server validates the plain text document and flags all occurrences of words that use ALL CAPS. The corresponding code snippet looks like this:

```typescript
// The content of a text document has changed. This event is emitted
// when the text document first opened or when its content has changed.
documents.onDidChangeContent(async (change) => {
	// In this simple example we get the settings for every validate run.
	let settings = await getDocumentSettings(textDocument.uri);

	// The validator creates diagnostics for all uppercase words length 2 and more
	let text = textDocument.getText();
	let pattern = /\b[A-Z]{2,}\b/g;
	let m: RegExpExecArray;

	let problems = 0;
	let diagnostics: Diagnostic[] = [];
	while ((m = pattern.exec(text))) {
		problems++;
		let diagnosic: Diagnostic = {
			severity: DiagnosticSeverity.Warning,
			range: {
				start: textDocument.positionAt(m.index),
				end: textDocument.positionAt(m.index + m[0].length)
			},
			message: `${m[0]} is all uppercase.`,
			source: 'ex'
		};
		if (hasDiagnosticRelatedInformationCapability) {
			diagnosic.relatedInformation = [
				{
					location: {
						uri: textDocument.uri,
						range: Object.assign({}, diagnosic.range)
					},
					message: 'Spelling matters'
				},
				{
					location: {
						uri: textDocument.uri,
						range: Object.assign({}, diagnosic.range)
					},
					message: 'Particularly for names'
				}
			];
		}
		diagnostics.push(diagnosic);
	}

	// Send the computed diagnostics to VSCode.
	connection.sendDiagnostics({ uri: textDocument.uri, diagnostics });
}
```

### Diagnostics Tips and Tricks

* If the start and end positions are the same, VS Code will squiggle the word at that position.
* If you want to squiggle until the end of the line, then set the character of the end position to Number.MAX_VALUE.

To test the language server, do the following:

* press `kb(workbench.action.tasks.build)` to start the build task. The task compiles both the client and the server.
* open the debug viewlet, select the `Launch Client` launch configuration and press the `Start Debugging` button to launch an additional `Extension Development Host` instance of VS Code that executes the extension code.
* Create a test.txt file in the root folder and paste the following content:

```bash
TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to.
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
ANY browser. ANY host. ANY OS. Open Source.
```

The `Extension Development Host` instance will then look like this:

## Logging Support for Language Server

If you are using `vscode-languageclient` to implement the client, you can specify a setting `[langId].trace.server` that instructs the Client to log communications between language client and server to the channel `[Language] Language Server`.

For **lsp-sample**, you can set this setting: `"languageServerExample.trace.server": "verbose"`. Now head to the channel "Language Server Example", and you should see the logs:

![LSP Log](images/example-language-server/lsp-log.png).

As LSP communications can be chatty (10 seconds usage can produce thousands line of log), we also provide a tool to visualize and filter the communication between Language Client / Server. Save all the logs into a log file, and load the file from the visualizer at https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/inspector.

## Debugging both Client and Server

Debugging the client code is as easy as debugging a normal extension. Set a breakpoint in the client code and debug the extension by pressing `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)`. For a detailed description about launching and debugging an extension see [Developing Extensions](/docs/extensions/developing-extensions.md).

![Debugging the client](images/example-language-server/debugging-client.png)

Since the server is started by the `LanguageClient` running in the extension (client), we need to attach a debugger to the running server. To do so, switch to the Debug view and select the launch configuration `Attach to Server` and press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)`. This will attach the debugger to the server.

![Debugging the server](images/example-language-server/debugging-server.png)

## Using Configuration Settings in the Server

When writing the client part of the extension, we already defined a setting to control the maximum numbers of problems reported. We also wrote code on the server side to read these settings from the client:

```typescript
function getDocumentSettings(resource: string): Thenable<ExampleSettings> {
	if (!hasConfigurationCapability) {
		return Promise.resolve(globalSettings);
	}
	let result = documentSettings.get(resource);
	if (!result) {
		result = connection.workspace.getConfiguration({ scopeUri: resource, section: 'languageServerExample' });
		documentSettings.set(resource, result);
	}
	return result;
}
```

The only thing we need to do now is to listen to configuration changes on the server side and if a settings changes, revalidate the open text documents. To be able to reuse the validate logic of the document change event handling, we extract the code into a `validateTextDocument` function and modify the code to honor a `maxNumberOfProblems` variable:

```typescript
async function validateTextDocument(textDocument: TextDocument): Promise<void> {
	// In this simple example we get the settings for every validate run.
	let settings = await getDocumentSettings(textDocument.uri);

	// The validator creates diagnostics for all uppercase words length 2 and more
	let text = textDocument.getText();
	let pattern = /\b[A-Z]{2,}\b/g;
	let m: RegExpExecArray;

	let problems = 0;
	let diagnostics: Diagnostic[] = [];
	while ((m = pattern.exec(text)) && problems < settings.maxNumberOfProblems) {
		problems++;
		let diagnosic: Diagnostic = {
			severity: DiagnosticSeverity.Warning,
			range: {
				start: textDocument.positionAt(m.index),
				end: textDocument.positionAt(m.index + m[0].length)
			},
			message: `${m[0]} is all uppercase.`,
			source: 'ex'
		};
		if (hasDiagnosticRelatedInformationCapability) {
			diagnosic.relatedInformation = [
				{
					location: {
						uri: textDocument.uri,
						range: Object.assign({}, diagnosic.range)
					},
					message: 'Spelling matters'
				},
				{
					location: {
						uri: textDocument.uri,
						range: Object.assign({}, diagnosic.range)
					},
					message: 'Particularly for names'
				}
			];
		}
		diagnostics.push(diagnosic);
	}

	// Send the computed diagnostics to VSCode.
	connection.sendDiagnostics({ uri: textDocument.uri, diagnostics });
}
```

The handling of the configuration change is done by adding a notification handler for configuration changes to the connection. The corresponding code looks like this:

```typescript
connection.onDidChangeConfiguration(change => {
	if (hasConfigurationCapability) {
		// Reset all cached document settings
		documentSettings.clear();
	} else {
		globalSettings = <ExampleSettings>(change.settings.languageServerExample || defaultSettings);
	}

	// Revalidate all open text documents
	documents.all().forEach(validateTextDocument);
});
```

Starting the client again and changing the setting to maximum report 1 problem results in the following validation:

![Maximum One Problem](images/example-language-server/validationOneProblem.png)

## Adding additional Language Features

The first interesting feature a language server usually implements is validation of documents. In that sense, even a linter counts as a language server and in VS Code linters are usually implemented as language servers (see [eslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) and [jshint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jshint) for examples). But there is more to language servers. They can provide code completion, Find All References or Go To Definition. The example code below adds code completion to the server. It proposes the two words 'TypeScript' and 'JavaScript'.

```typescript
// This handler provides the initial list of the completion items.
connection.onCompletion((textDocumentPosition: TextDocumentPositionParams): CompletionItem[] => {
    // The passed parameter contains the position in the text document in
    // which code completion was requested. For this example, we ignore this
    // information and always provide the same completion items.
    return [
        {
            label: 'TypeScript',
            kind: CompletionItemKind.Text,
            data: 1
        },
        {
            label: 'JavaScript',
            kind: CompletionItemKind.Text,
            data: 2
        }
    ];
});

// This handler resolves additional information for the item selected in
// the completion list.
connection.onCompletionResolve((item: CompletionItem): CompletionItem => {
    if (item.data === 1) {
        item.detail = 'TypeScript details',
        item.documentation = 'TypeScript documentation'
    } else if (item.data === 2) {
        item.detail = 'JavaScript details',
        item.documentation = 'JavaScript documentation'
    }
    return item;
});
```

The `data` fields is used to uniquely identify a completion item in the resolve handler. The data property is transparent for the protocol. Since the underlying message passing protocol is JSON based, the data field should only hold data that is serializable to and from JSON.

All that is missing is to tell VS Code that the server supports code completion requests. To do so, flag the corresponding capability in the initialize handler:

```typescript
connection.onInitialize((params): InitializeResult => {
    ...
    return {
        capabilities: {
            ...
            // Tell the client that the server supports code completion
            completionProvider: {
                resolveProvider: true
            }
        }
    };
});
```

The screen shot below shows the completed code running on a plain text file:

![Code Complete](images/example-language-server/codeComplete.png)

## Additional Language Server features

The following language features are currently supported in a language server along with code completions:

* _Document Highlights_: highlights all 'equal' symbols in a text document.
* _Hover_: provides hover information for a symbol selected in a text document.
* _Signature Help_: provides signature help for a symbol selected in a text document.
* _Goto Definition_: provides go to definition support for a symbol selected in a text document.
* _Find References_: finds all project-wide references for a symbol selected in a text document.
* _List Document Symbols_: lists all symbols defined in a text document.
* _List Workspace Symbols_: lists all project-wide symbols.
* _Code Actions_: compute commands for a given text document and range.
* _CodeLens_: compute CodeLens statistics for a given text document.
* _Document Formatting_: this includes formatting of whole documents, document ranges and formatting on type.
* _Rename_: project-wide rename of a symbol.
* _Document Links_: compute and resolve links inside a document.

The [Language Extension Guidelines](/docs/extensionAPI/language-support.md) topic describes each of the language features above and provides guidance on how to implement them either through the language server protocol or by using the extensibility API directly from your extension.

## Incremental Text Document Synchronization

The example uses the simple text document manager provided by the `vscode-languageserver` module to synchronize documents between VS Code and the language server.

This has two drawbacks:

* Lots of data transfer since the whole content of a text document is sent to the server repeatedly.
* If an existing language library is used, such libraries usually support incremental document updates to avoid unnecessary parsing and abstract syntax tree creation.

The protocol therefore supports incremental document synchronization as well.

To make use of incremental document synchronization, a server needs to install three notification handlers:

* _onDidOpenTextDocument_: is called when a text document is opened in VS Code.
* _onDidChangeTextDocument_: is called when the content of a text document changes in VS Code.
* _onDidCloseTextDocument_: is called when a text document is closed in VS Code.

Below is a code snippet that illustrates how to hook these notification handlers on a connection and how to return the right capability on initialize:

```typescript
connection.onInitialize((params): InitializeResult => {
    ...
    return {
        capabilities: {
            // Enable incremental document sync
            textDocumentSync: TextDocumentSyncKind.Incremental,
            ...
        }
    };
});

connection.onDidOpenTextDocument((params) => {
    // A text document was opened in VS Code.
    // params.uri uniquely identifies the document. For documents stored on disk, this is a file URI.
    // params.text the initial full content of the document.
});

connection.onDidChangeTextDocument((params) => {
    // The content of a text document has change in VS Code.
    // params.uri uniquely identifies the document.
    // params.contentChanges describe the content changes to the document.
});

connection.onDidCloseTextDocument((params) => {
    // A text document was closed in VS Code.
    // params.uri uniquely identifies the document.
});
```

## Common Questions

**Q: When I try to attach to the server, I get "cannot connect to runtime process (timeout after 5000ms)"?**

**A:** You will see this timeout error if the server isn't running when you try to attach the debugger.  The client starts the language server so make sure you have started the client in order to have a running server. You may also need to disable your client breakpoints if they are interfering with starting the server.
