## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.25 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/51483)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/69?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the June milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Grid Editor Layout

You can now arrange editors both vertically and horizontally and have more than 3 editors side by side:

![Grid Editor Layout](images/1_25/grid-layout.gif)

To support flexible layouts, you can create empty editor groups. By default, closing the last editor of an editor group will also close the group itself, but you can change this behavior with the new setting `workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups: false`.

![Grid Empty](images/1_25/grid-empty.png)

There are a predefined set of editor layouts in the new **View** > **Editor Layout** menu:

![Grid Editor Layout Menu](images/1_25/grid-layout-menu.png)

Editors that open to the side (for example by clicking the editor toolbar **Split Editor** action) will by default open to the right hand side of the active editor. If you prefer to open editors below the active one, configure the new setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection: down`.

There are many [new commands](#new-commands) for adjusting the editor layout with the keyboard alone, but if you prefer to use the mouse, drag and drop is a fast way to split the editor into any direction:

![Grid Editor Drag and Drop](images/1_25/grid-dnd.gif)

Since editor groups are now unlimited and can be arranged in many ways, the **OPEN EDITORS** view no longer labels editor groups as **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**. Instead, editor groups are now labeled with numbers according to their creation time. Thus, the last editor group created will always be at the end of the **OPEN EDITORS** list. We found this to be a good model that minimizes changing the list when moving editor groups around in the layout:

![Grid Open Editors View](images/1_25/grid-open-editors.png)

Refer to the [Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring) section for the impact on extensions and themes and see [New Commands](#new-commands) for the list of new editor grid commands.

>**Pro Tip**: If you press and hold the `Alt` key while hovering over the toolbar action to split an editor, it will offer to split to the other orientation. This is a fast way to split either to the right or to the bottom.

### Language Packs

VS Code now ships with only English as the display language and other [languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/locales#_available-locales) now rely on Language Packs installable from the VS Code [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Downloads). You should not notice this change if you had installed a Language Pack when prompted by the 1.23 or 1.24 versions of VS Code. If you are upgrading from an older version of VS Code or have a fresh installation, you will see a prompt to install the Language Pack of your OS's UI language. Additional Language Packs can be installed from the Marketplace using the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`).

To summarize:

* If you update from VS Code version 1.22 or older to 1.25, the display language will be English and VS Code will prompt you to install the Language Pack for the OS's UI language, if such a Language Pack is available in the Marketplace.
* If you update from 1.23 or 1.24 to 1.25, you should already have been prompted to install the Language Pack for the UI language. If you did so, 1.25 will start as normal and the display language is presented as the chosen UI language. If you didn't install a Language Pack, then you will be prompted to do so.
* Fresh installs of VS Code, version 1.25 or higher, will prompt you to install a Language Pack if an appropriate one is available in the Marketplace.

### Drop files and folders into empty files explorer

Now it is possible to drop files, folders and code-workspace files into an empty explorer to open them.

![empty drop](images/1_25/drop.gif)

## Debugging

### Breakpoint state per session

Each breakpoint in VS Code has state asociated with a debug session. For example, a debugger can move a breakpoint to a new line number or column. This can get complex when debugging multiple sesisons at the same time, as each session can set some different state on a breakpoint.
Now the UI properly reflects only the breakpoint state of the active debug session. Focusing on a different debug session can change breakpoint state (like location, verification status, message).

### Debug toolbar in the editor area

In the previous milestone we have introduced an option to dock the debug toolbar to the debug view area using the option `"debug.toolBarLocation": "docked"`. After listening to user feedback we decided to make the default `"floating"` option more flexible by allowing the debug toolbar to be dragged to the editor area. This should help users that heavily use editor tabs but also want to see the debug toolbar at all times.


![debug toolbar](images/1_25/debugtoolbar.gif)


## Extension Authoring

### Grid Editor Layout: ViewColumn

There are only a few API adjustments to support the new editor grid layout feature. Most notably, there is a new `ViewColumn.Beside` action that can be used to open an editor to the side of the active one. With the grid editor layout, there is no longer a limit in the number of opened editors, so using that option will always create a new editor to the side of the active one unless there is already some space to the side. Depending on the user setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection`, this can either be to the right or below the editor.

The `ViewColumn` value for text editors and webviews still goes by the order of appearance in the editor area from left to right as shown below:

![Grid Editor Numbering](images/1_25/grid-numbering.png)

Even though the `ViewColumn` enumeration was extended all the way to `ViewColumn.Nine`, a `TextEditor` will always have a number assigned as view column as long as it is contained in the grid.

When an editor group is moved or an editor group is closed, the `onDidChangeTextEditorViewColumn` event is fired as before.

### Grid Editor Layout: New Commands

Even though the change to the API is minimal to support the new grid editor layout, extensions can still make use of the grid editor layout by leveraging new commands that were added (see the [New Commands](#new-commands) section for a complete overview).

The new `vscode.setEditorLayout` deserves a bit of explanation as it allows you to change the overall editor layout with a single command and arguments. The layout is described as object with an initial (optional) orientation (`0` = horizontal, `1` = vertical) and an array of editor `groups` within. Each editor group can have a `size` and another array of editor `groups` that will be laid out orthogonal to the orientation. If editor group sizes are provided, their sum must be `1` to be applied per row or column.

Example for a 2x2 grid:

```json
{ orientation: 0, groups: [{ groups: [{}, {}], size: 0.5 }, { groups: [{}, {}], size: 0.5 }] }
```

### Editors open in active ViewColumn by default

If no `ViewColumn` is provided when opening a text editor or webview , VS Code now defaults to opening in the currently active editor group, instead of opening it in `ViewColumn.One`. If you want to preserve the previous behavior, just pass in `ViewColumn.One` when opening.

### Readonly file system provider

A file system provider can now be registered as `readonly`. VSCode will respect this flag by disabling all the mutating commands on the resources coming from that file system provider. Editors will also be opened in readonly mode for those readonly resources.

### New Theme colors

There are two new theme colors for the background color of empty editor groups, a feature that came out of the work to support editor grid layout:

* `editorGroup.emptyBackground`: Background color of an empty editor group.
* `editorGroup.focusedEmptyBorder`: Border color of an empty editor group that is focused.

![Grid Editor Group Background](images/1_25/grid-background.png)

* `editorPane.background`: Background color of the editor pane visible on the left and right side of the centered editor layout

![Editor Pane Background](images/1_25/editorPaneBackground.png)


### Deprecated Theme colors

The theme color `editorGroup.background` is no longer supported with the introduction of the grid editor layout feature.

### New `layoutEditorGroups` command

The `layoutEditorGroups` command lets you set an editor group layout the way you like and assign it a keybinding. The layout is described as object with an initial (optional) orientation (`0` = horizontal, `1` = vertical) and an array of editor `groups` within. Each editor group can have a `size` and another array of editor `groups` that will be laid out orthogonal to the orientation. If editor group sizes are provided, their sum must be `1` to be applied per row or column. For example:

```json
{
    "key": "Ctrl+0",
    "command": "layoutEditorGroups",
    "args": {
        "orientation": 1,
        "groups": [{ "size": 0.2 }, { "size": 0.6 }, { "size": 0.2, "groups": [{}, {}] }]
    }
}
```

This will produce the following layout:
