## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.25 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/51483)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/69?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the June milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Grid Editor Layout

You can now arrange editors both vertically and horizontally and have more than 3 editors side by side:

![Grid Editor Layout](images/1_25/grid-layout.gif)

To support flexible layouts, you can create empty editor groups. By default, closing the last editor of an editor group will also close the group itself, but you can change this behavior with the new setting `workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups: false`.

![Grid Empty](images/1_25/grid-empty.png)

There are a predefined set of editor layouts in the new **View** > **Editor Layout** menu:

![Grid Editor Layout Menu](images/1_25/grid-layout-menu.png)

Editors that open to the side (for example by clicking the editor toolbar **Split Editor** action) will by default open to the right hand side of the active editor. If you prefer to open editors below the active one, configure the new setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection: down`.

There are many [new commands](#new-commands) for adjusting the editor layout with the keyboard alone, but if you prefer to use the mouse, drag and drop is a fast way to split the editor into any direction:

![Grid Editor Drag and Drop](images/1_25/grid-dnd.gif)

Since editor groups are now unlimited and can be arranged in many ways, the **OPEN EDITORS** view no longer labels editor groups as **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**. Instead, editor groups are now labeled with numbers according to their creation time. Thus, the last editor group created will always be at the end of the **OPEN EDITORS** list. We found this to be a good model that minimizes changing the list when moving editor groups around in the layout:

![Grid Open Editors View](images/1_25/grid-open-editors.png)

Refer to the [Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring) section for the impact on extensions and themes and see [New Commands](#new-commands) for the list of new editor grid commands.

>**Pro Tip**: If you press and hold the `Alt` key while hovering over the toolbar action to split an editor, it will offer to split to the other orientation. This is a fast way to split either to the right or to the bottom.

## Extension Authoring

### Grid Editor Layout: ViewColumn

There are only a few API adjustments to support the new editor grid layout feature. Most notably, there is a new `ViewColumn.Beside` action that can be used to open an editor to the side of the active one. With the grid editor layout, there is no longer a limit in the number of opened editors, so using that option will always create a new editor to the side of the active one unless there is already some space to the side. Depending on the user setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection`, this can either be to the right or below the editor.

The `ViewColumn` value for text editors and webviews still goes by the order of appearance in the editor area from left to right as shown below:

![Grid Editor Numbering](images/1_25/grid-numbering.png)

Even though the `ViewColumn` enumeration was extended all the way to `ViewColumn.Nine`, a `TextEditor` will always have a number assigned as view column as long as it is contained in the grid.

When an editor group is moved or an editor group is closed, the `onDidChangeTextEditorViewColumn` event is fired as before.

### Grid Editor Layout: New Commands

Even though the change to the API is minimal to support the new grid editor layout, extensions can still make use of the grid editor layout by leveraging new commands that were added (see the [New Commands](#new-commands) section for a complete overview).

The new `vscode.setEditorLayout` deserves a bit of explanation as it allows you to change the overall editor layout with a single command and arguments. The layout is described as object with an initial (optional) orientation (`0` = horizontal, `1` = vertical) and an array of editor `groups` within. Each editor group can have a `size` and another array of editor `groups` that will be laid out orthogonal to the orientation. If editor group sizes are provided, their sum must be `1` to be applied per row or column.

Example for a 2x2 grid:

```json
{ orientation: 0, groups: [{ groups: [{}, {}], size: 0.5 }, { groups: [{}, {}], size: 0.5 }] }
```

### Editors open in active ViewColumn by default

If no `ViewColumn` is provided when opening a text editor or webview , VS Code now defaults to opening in the currently active editor group, instead of opening it in `ViewColumn.One`. If you want to preserve the previous behavior, just pass in `ViewColumn.One` when opening.

### New Theme colors

There are two new theme colors for the background color of empty editor groups, a feature that came out of the work to support editor grid layout:

* `editorGroup.emptyBackground`: Background color of an empty editor group.
* `editorGroup.focusedEmptyBorder`: Border color of an empty editor group that is focused.

![Grid Editor Group Background](images/1_25/grid-background.png)

### Deprecated Theme colors

The theme color `editorGroup.background` is no longer supported with the introduction of the grid editor layout feature.

### New `layoutEditorGroups` command

The `layoutEditorGroups` command lets you set an editor group layout the way you like and assign it a keybinding. The layout is described as object with an initial (optional) orientation (`0` = horizontal, `1` = vertical) and an array of editor `groups` within. Each editor group can have a `size` and another array of editor `groups` that will be laid out orthogonal to the orientation. If editor group sizes are provided, their sum must be `1` to be applied per row or column. For example:

```json
{
    "key": "Ctrl+0",
    "command": "layoutEditorGroups",
    "args": {
        "orientation": 1,
        "groups": [{ "size": 0.2 }, { "size": 0.6 }, { "size": 0.2, "groups": [{}, {}] }]
    }
}
```

This will produce the following layout:
