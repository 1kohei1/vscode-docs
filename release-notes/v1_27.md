## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.27 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55927)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/74?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the August milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### New Terminal Menu

The **Tasks** menu was renamed to **Terminal** and some more entries for the Integrated Terminal were added.

### Files no longer close when deleted/renamed externally

We changed the default of the `workbench.editor.closeOnFileDelete` setting from `true` to `false`. This means that a file that has been deleted or renamed outside of VS Code (or by another program like Git or command from the Integrated Terminal) will no longer close a file that is opened as editor tab. Instead, the file will indicate that it has been deleted from disk and you can just save the file to restore it.

**Note:** Unless the file is dirty, the contents of the file are not preserved between restarts.

### Accessibility improvements

We have fixed  quite some accessibility issues - mostly around keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus. The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22August+2018%22+is%3Aclosed). This is an ongoing effort which we plan to continue in September.

## Extension Authoring

### Extension Logging

The `ExtensionContext` that comes as an argument of the `activate`-function has a new property [`logPath`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/526f4c149211773357b2ce9f62c2a9973612a16a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L4541-L4546). That is an absolute file path of a directory in which extensions can store log files. The path is unique for the respective extension and not reused for other extensions.

### Language Server Protocol

A new version of the language server protocol together with the corresponding node modules for VS Code has been releases. The new version has support for code action kind announcement from the server to allow clients to popluate corresponding menu entries, an implementation for a [`textDocument/prepareRename`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_prepareRename) and support for file operations (create, rename and delete) in [Workspace Edits](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_applyEdit)

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we explored bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in the near future to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Engineering

### Extensions & Webpack

We are now using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle extensions. It unlocks two achievements: (1) reduce the startup time for extensions because less files and less code needs to be loaded and parsed and (2) reduce the install time because less files needs to extracted and written. So far, we could reduce the bundle size by ~4000 files!

### Performance Canary

We have added another harness to ensure that our startup performance isn't regressing. There is a new script that can be deployed to dedicated machines to test the performance of insider builds - the script simply installs latest and makes sure that it starts within a time limit. For now, we started with Windows because performance there is often affected by updates of anti- virus software but the plan is to have machines for all platforms we support.


## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.newWindowTab)`|Open a window as new native tab (macOS only, needs `window.nativeTabs` to be enabled)|workbench.action.newWindowTab
