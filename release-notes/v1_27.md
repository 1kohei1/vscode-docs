## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.27 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55927)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/74?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the August milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### New Terminal menu

The **Tasks** menu was renamed to **Terminal** and some more entries for the Integrated Terminal were added.

### Files no longer close when deleted/renamed externally

We changed the default of the `workbench.editor.closeOnFileDelete` setting from `true` to `false`. This means that a file that has been deleted or renamed outside of VS Code (or by another program like Git or command from the Integrated Terminal) will no longer close a file that is opened as editor tab. Instead, the file will indicate that it has been deleted from disk and you can just save the file to restore it.

**Note:** Unless the file is dirty, the contents of the file are not preserved between restarts.

### Breadcrumb improvements

We have tweaked the new breadcrumbs bar, made various improvements, and fixed bugs:

* Focused document symbols are now highlighted in the editor.
* Breadcrumbs are automatically enabled when the focus command (`kb(breadcrumbs.focus)`) is run.
* Breadcrumbs work a lot better with themes.
* Breadcrumbs now honor the file excludes configuration.

### Accessibility improvements

We have fixed  quite some accessibility issues - mostly around keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus. The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22August+2018%22+is%3Aclosed). This is an ongoing effort which we plan to continue in September.

## Debugging

### Built-in Loaded Scripts view
TODO@ANDRE

### Breakpoints: Middle click to remove
Now it is possible to use the middle mouse click in the breakpoints view to easily remove a breakpoint.

### Change the default for "openDebug" to open on every session start

For new users, it can sometimes be confusing when you start a debug session and the debug view does not open automatically every time. If the user is not yet familiar with the UI, he doesn't know what keywords to look for in order to change this. Due to that we changed the default of `debug.openDebug` to be `openOnSessionStart` so that the debug view opens on every session start, not only on the first (which was the previous default behavior).

## Extension Authoring

### Debugging: Built-in Loaded Scripts view
TODO@ANDRE

### Extension logging

The `ExtensionContext` that comes as an argument of the `activate` function has a new property [`logPath`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/526f4c149211773357b2ce9f62c2a9973612a16a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L4541-L4546). This is the absolute file path of a directory where extensions can store log files. The path is unique for an extension and not reused by other extensions.

### Language Server Protocol

A new version of the Language Server Protocol is available and includes the corresponding node modules for use with VS Code.

The new version has support for:

* Code Action kind announcements from the server to allow clients to populate corresponding menu entries.
* An implementation for a [`textDocument/prepareRename`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_prepareRename).
* Support for file operations (create, rename and delete) in [Workspace Edits](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_applyEdit).

### New theme colors

There is a new theme color for breadcrumbs:

* `breadcrumb.background`: Background color of breadcrumb items.

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we explored bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in the near future to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Engineering

### Extensions and webpack

We are now using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle extensions. It unlocks two achievements: (1) reduce the startup time for extensions because there are fewer files to load and less source to parse and (2) reduce the install time because fewer files need to extracted and written to disk. So far, we've reduced the bundle size by ~4000 files!

### Performance canary

We have added a test harness to ensure that our startup performance isn't regressing. There is a new script that can be deployed to dedicated machines to test the performance of Insider builds. The script simply installs the latest build and makes sure that it starts within a time limit. For now, we started with Windows because performance is often affected by updates to anti-virus software but the plan is to test on all platforms we support.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.newWindowTab)`|Open a window as new native tab (macOS only, needs `window.nativeTabs` to be enabled)|workbench.action.newWindowTab
