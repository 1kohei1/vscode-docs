## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.29 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60106)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/78?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the October milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Highlight modified tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs` allows to draw a thick border to the top of editor tabs whenever the editor is dirty. This makes it easier to find tabs that are not yet saved. The color of the border can be customized (see below).

### macOS Mojave: Dark Mode Support

The macOS Mojave dark mode is now better supported in VSCode. Previously, the menu and dialogs would show with the default light theme, even if macOS was running in dark theme. Now, all native pieces will show with the dark mode if enabled.

### macOS Simple Fullscreen Support

A new setting `window.nativeFullscreen` was introduced that - if set to `false` - allows to enable a fullscreen mode for VSCode that does not use the native macOS fullscreen features of windows. This has the advantage that entering fullscreen will not create a macOS space on the desktop. By default, VSCode will still use the macOS native fullscreen feature.

### Windows: removed smoothScrollingWorkaround setting

The window.smoothScrollingWorkaround setting was removed and is no longer supported. It was introduced as a workaround for an issue where scrolling with the mouse became laggy once the VSCode window was minimized and restored (see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13612). This issue was resolved with the Windows 10 Redstone 5 update. If you see this issue, please update Windows 10 to the latest version.

### Notifications automatically hide even when showing buttons

We used to never hide notifications after a certain duration if they include buttons. This resulted in potentially lots of notifications piling up in the lower right corner covering parts of the editor. With this release we will hide all notifications after a timeout even if they show buttons. There are two exceptions:
* notifications with error severity will not hide automatically assuming that the user needs to take immediate action
* few selected notifications from VSCode will remain open, e.g. the notification that asks wether you want to opt-out of telemetry

**Note:** even if the notifications hide after a timeout, you can always access all notifications from the notifications center, e.g. by clicking on the little bell icon in the status bar or via the `notifications.toggleList` command.

## Extension Authoring

### Notifications with buttons hide after a timeout

If your extension is using the `showInformationMessage` or `showWarningMessage` API with the non-modal option and buttons, please note that these notifications will now hide after a certain timeout. Only notifications triggered via `showErrorMessage` and having buttons will stay as before. If you must get immediate input from the user or show a message prominently, you can still use `modal: true` as option. This will bring up a modal dialog that blocks the user from doing anything until dismissed. We however discourage from abusing this option if possible because it will interrupt the user from using the editor.

### Extension globalState updates across windows

If you are using `context.globalState` to store data globally, we now send changes to this data to all other windows that might be opened running your extension. There is currently no event when this happens, but the data will always be in sync with the latest change that was made.

### New theme colors

There are new theme colors:

* `tab.activeModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) active tabs in an active group.
* `tab.inactiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) inactive tabs in an active group.
* `tab.unfocusedActiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) active tabs in an unfocused group.
* `tab.unfocusedInactiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) inactive tabs in an unfocused group.

## Notable Fixes
