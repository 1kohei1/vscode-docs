## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.29 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60106)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/78?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the October milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Highlight modified tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs` displays a thick border at the top of editor tabs whenever the editor is dirty (has unsaved changes). This makes it easier to find files that need to be saved. The color of the border can be customized (see below).

### macOS Mojave: Dark mode support

The macOS Mojave dark mode is now better supported in VS Code. Previously, VS Code menus and dialogs would show with the default light theme, even if macOS was running in dark theme. Now, all native UI elements will show with the dark mode if enabled.

### macOS: Simple full screen support

A new setting `window.nativeFullscreen` was introduced that, if set to `false`, will enable full screen mode for VS Code that does not use the native macOS full screen feature. This has the advantage that entering full screen mode will not create a macOS space on the desktop. By default, VS Code will still use macOS native full screen.

### Windows: Removed smoothScrollingWorkaround setting

The `window.smoothScrollingWorkaround` setting was removed and is no longer supported. It was introduced as a workaround for an issue where scrolling with the mouse became laggy once the VS Code window was minimized and restored (see issue [13612](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13612)). This issue was resolved with the Windows 10 Redstone 5 update. If you see this issue, please update Windows 10 to the latest version.

### Notifications automatically hide even when showing buttons

Previously, VS Code would never hide notifications if they included buttons. This resulted in the potential for notifications to pile up in the lower right corner and cover parts of the editor. With this release, notifications are hidden after a timeout even if they show buttons.

There are two exceptions:

* Notifications with `error` severity will not be hidden on the assumption that the user needs to take some action.
* A few specific notifications from VS Code will remain open. For example, the notification that asks whether you want to opt-out of sending telemetry.

**Note:** Even if notifications are hidden, you can always access all notifications from the Notification Center, either by clicking on the little bell icon in the Status bar or via the **Show Notifications** (`notifications.toggleList`) command.

## Extension Authoring

### Notifications with buttons hide after a timeout

If your extension is using the `showInformationMessage` or `showWarningMessage` API with the non-modal option and buttons, note that these notifications will now hide after a certain timeout. Only notifications triggered via `showErrorMessage` and having buttons will stay open as before. If you must get immediate input from the user or need to show a message prominently, you can still use `modal: true` as option. This will bring up a modal dialog that blocks the user from doing anything until dismissed. We do however discourage overuse of this option because it interrupts the user.

### Extension globalState updates across windows

If you are using `context.globalState` to store data globally, we now send changes to this data to all other windows (instances) that might be opened running your extension. There is currently no event when this happens, but the data will always be in sync with the latest change that was made.

### New theme colors

There are new theme colors:

* `tab.activeModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) active tabs in an active group.
* `tab.inactiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) inactive tabs in an active group.
* `tab.unfocusedActiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) active tabs in an unfocused group.
* `tab.unfocusedInactiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) inactive tabs in an unfocused group.

## Notable Fixes

* [59305](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/59305): Show a "Open Workspace" button in .code-workspace files
