## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.29 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60106)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/78?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the October milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Highlight modified tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs` displays a thick border at the top of editor tabs whenever the editor is dirty (has unsaved changes). This makes it easier to find files that need to be saved. The color of the border can be customized (see below).

![Highlight modified tabs](images/1_29/highlight-modified-tabs.gif)

### Symbol Order in Breadcrumbs

There is a new setting that controls how symbols in the breadcrumbs picker are ordered: `breadcrumbs.symbolSortOrder`. Allows values are `position` (default), `name`, and `type`.

![Breadcrumb Picker Ordered By Name](images/1_29/breadcrumb-order.png)

### Breadcrumbs and Preview Editors

When middle clicking items in the breadcrumbs they now open as new editor, just like it does when middle clicking files in the explorer.

### macOS Mojave: Dark mode support

The macOS Mojave dark mode is now better supported in VS Code. Previously, VS Code menus and dialogs would show with the default light theme, even if macOS was running in dark theme. Now, all native UI elements will show with the dark mode if enabled.

### macOS: Simple full screen support

A new setting `window.nativeFullScreen` was introduced that, if set to `false`, will enable full screen mode for VS Code that does not use the native macOS full screen feature. This has the advantage that entering full screen mode will not create a macOS space on the desktop. By default, VS Code will still use macOS native full screen.

### Windows: Removed smoothScrollingWorkaround setting

The `window.smoothScrollingWorkaround` setting was removed and is no longer supported. It was introduced as a workaround for an issue where scrolling with the mouse became laggy once the VS Code window was minimized and restored (see issue [13612](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13612)). This issue was resolved with the Windows 10 Redstone 5 update. If you see this issue, please update Windows 10 to the latest version.

### Notifications automatically hide even when showing buttons

Previously, VS Code would never hide notifications if they included buttons. This resulted in the potential for notifications to pile up in the lower right corner and cover parts of the editor. With this release, notifications are hidden after a timeout even if they show buttons.

There are two exceptions:

* Notifications with `error` severity will not be hidden on the assumption that the user needs to take some action.
* A few specific notifications from VS Code will remain open. For example, the notification that asks whether you want to opt-out of sending telemetry.

**Note:** Even if notifications are hidden, you can always access all notifications from the Notification Center, either by clicking on the little bell icon in the Status bar or via the **Show Notifications** (`notifications.toggleList`) command.

### Centered editor layout auto resize

We have added a new setting `workbench.editor.centeredLayoutAutoResize` which by default is enabled. When this setting is enabled the centered layout view will automatically resize to max width when more than 1 editor group is open. This should make the centered layout require less manual toggling and make it easier to use in general.

### Moved panel toggle location button from title bar to context menu
TODO@isidor

### New default for `files.eol`: `auto`

A new default value `auto` is introduced for `files.eol` setting. When set, end of line character for new files is computed based on the operating system in which VS Code is running. It is `\r\n` in Windows and `\n` in Mac and Linux.

## Editor

### File & Folder Icons in IntelliSense

The IntelliSense widget now shows file and folder icons of your theme for file completions. This unifies the look and helps telling different files apart.

![File Icons in IntelliSense](images/1_29/completion-file-icons.png)

### Format Selection

To speed up small formatting operations, "Format Selection" without a selection will now format the current line.

**Show error codes**

Editor now shows the error code of a problem if it has any.

![error codes](images/1_29/error-code.png)

## Integrated Terminal

### Split terminal can inherit working directory

A new setting `terminal.integrated.splitCwd` was added that allows configuring what current working directory (cwd) a terminal gets when a terminal is split:

* `workspaceRoot`: The previous behavior; a new split terminal will use the workspace root as the working directory. In a multi-root workspace, a choice for which root folder to use is offered.
* `initial`: A new split terminal will use the working directory that the parent terminal started with.
* `inherited`: On macOS and Linux, a new split terminal will use the working directory of the parent terminal. On Windows, this behaves the same as `initial`.

### Experimental buffer improvements

A new setting `terminal.integrated.experimentalBufferLineImpl` allows changing how the terminal stores its buffer to a `TypedArray`/`ArrayBuffer`-based implementation. If you would like to opt-in, you can expect performance improvements across the board including reduced memory usage and garbage collection, and an overall increase to the throughput of the terminal.

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.experimentalBufferImpl": "TypedArray"
}
```

This is just the beginning, we're expecting further improvements to throughput and memory usage over the next couple of releases before making this the default implementation. A special thanks to [@jerch](https://github.com/jerch) from the [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) team, who has been the main driving force behind this [multi-month project](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/791).

### Cmd+Backspace to delete to the start of the line

A new keybinding was added on macOS for `Cmd+Backspace` which sends `\u0015` (Ctrl+U) to the terminal. In bash, this deletes from the cursor to the start of the line, in zsh, it deletes the whole line.

## Tasks

### Clear terminal before executing task

A new `presentation` propery was added for tasks. Set the `clear` property to `true` in a task to clear the terminal before the task is run.

## Debugging

### Multi debug console
TODO@Isidor

### Collapsable stack frames

### Start debugging with stop on entry

### Breakpoint widget expands to multiple lines

## Engineering

### Continued Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we continued to explore bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in the near future to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Miscellaneous

### Workspace storage back end changed to SQLite

In preparation of the upcoming Electron 3.0 update, we are moving our storage solution away from `window.localStorage` to our own solution with a SQLite back end (more information in issue [58957](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58957)). You should not notice any difference and existing data is migrated. In this milestone, only workspace storage is affected, while in the next milestone, we will also move global storage out. Once this transition is done, we will be able to push the Electron 3.0 update to our Insiders channel.

### Electron update

In this release, we updated from Electron 2.0.9 to 2.0.12.

## Extension Authoring

### Active terminal APIs

The proposed APIs that give access to the active terminal, `window.activeTerminal` and `window.onDidChangeActiveTerminal`, are now stable.

### Notifications with buttons hide after a timeout

If your extension is using the `showInformationMessage` or `showWarningMessage` API with the non-modal option and buttons, note that these notifications will now hide after a certain timeout. Only notifications triggered via `showErrorMessage` and having buttons will stay open as before. If you must get immediate input from the user or need to show a message prominently, you can still use `modal: true` as option. This will bring up a modal dialog that blocks the user from doing anything until dismissed. We do however discourage overuse of this option because it interrupts the user.

### Extension globalState updates across windows

If you are using `context.globalState` to store data globally, we now send changes to this data to all other windows (instances) that might be opened running your extension. There is currently no event when this happens, but the data will always be in sync with the latest change that was made.

### Active terminal APIs

The proposed APIs that give access to the active terminal, `window.activeTerminal` and `window.onDidChangeActiveTerminal`, are now stable.

### Custom views: Expand revealed elements

You can now expand the element to reveal using `expand` option in `reveal` api. It also supports to recursively expand the decendents by passing the number of levels.

**NOTE:** You can recursively expand only to 3 levels maximum.

```typescript
/**
 * Reveals the given element in the tree view.
 * If the tree view is not visible then the tree view is shown and element is revealed.
 *
 * By default revealed element is selected.
 * In order to not to select, set the option `select` to `false`.
 * In order to focus, set the option `focus` to `true`.
 * In order to expand the revealed element, set the option `expand` to `true`. To expand recursively set `expand` to the number of levels to expand.
 * **NOTE:** You can expand only to 3 levels maximum.
 *
 * **NOTE:** [TreeDataProvider](#TreeDataProvider) is required to implement [getParent](#TreeDataProvider.getParent) method to access this API.
 */
reveal(element: T, options?: { select?: boolean, focus?: boolean, expand?: boolean | number }): Thenable<void>;
```

### New theme colors

There are new theme colors:

* `tab.activeModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) active tabs in an active group.
* `tab.inactiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) inactive tabs in an active group.
* `tab.unfocusedActiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) active tabs in an unfocused group.
* `tab.unfocusedInactiveModifiedBorder`: Border on the top of modified (dirty) inactive tabs in an unfocused group.
* `editor.stackFrameHighlightBackground`: Background color of the top debug stack frame highlight in the editor. By default this color is yellow.
* `editor.focusedStackFrameHighlightBackground`: Background color of the focused debug stack frame highlight in the editor. By default this color is green.

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Clipboard API

We have proposed API to access the clipboard. It follows the up-coming clipboard API in [browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard) and currently allows to read and write text:

```ts
export interface Clipboard {
  readText(): Thenable<string>;
  writeText(value: string): Thenable<void>;
}
export namespace env {
  const const clipboard: Clipboard;
}
```

### Completion Text Insert Rules

We have new proposed API with which the insert behaviour of completion items can be tweaked. By default, multiline completions get 're-formatted' to match in the indentation of the current line. Sometimes that is unwanted and new proposed API allows to turn that off. `CompletionItemInsertTextRule` is a new bitmask that a completion can have for those tweaks.

### Custom views

**Collapse All action**

You can add `Collapse All` action to your view by just setting `showCollapseAll` option to `true` while creating the `TreeView`. VS Code provides the collapse all functionality and shows it with same icon and at consistent location for all opted in views.

```typescript
/**
 * Options for creating a [TreeView](#TreeView]
 */
export interface TreeViewOptions<T> {

	/**
	 * A data provider that provides tree data.
	 */
	treeDataProvider: TreeDataProvider<T>;

	/**
	 * Whether to show collapse all action or not.
	 */
	showCollapseAll?: boolean;
}

namespace window {

	export function createTreeView<T>(viewId: string, options: TreeViewOptions<T>): TreeView<T>;

}
```

![Collapse All](images/1_29/view-collapse-all.png)

**TreeItem Label Highlights**

You can highlight the `TreeItem` label by providing the ranges using `highlights` option. Since it is a proposed API, you have to use `TreeItem2` to update highlights.

```typescript
/**
 * Label describing the [Tree item](#TreeItem)
 */
export interface TreeItemLabel {

	/**
	 * A human-readable string describing the [Tree item](#TreeItem).
	 */
	label: string;

	/**
	 * Ranges in the label to highlight. A range is defined as a tuple of two number where the
	 * first is the inclusive start index and the second the exclusive end index
	 */
	highlights?: [number, number][];

}

export class TreeItem2 extends TreeItem {
	/**
	 * Label describing this item. When `falsy`, it is derived from [resourceUri](#TreeItem.resourceUri).
	 */
	label?: string | TreeItemLabel | /* for compilation */ any;

	/**
	 * @param label Label describing this item
	 * @param collapsibleState [TreeItemCollapsibleState](#TreeItemCollapsibleState) of the tree item. Default is [TreeItemCollapsibleState.None](#TreeItemCollapsibleState.None)
	 */
	constructor(label: TreeItemLabel, collapsibleState?: TreeItemCollapsibleState);
}
```
