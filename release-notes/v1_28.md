## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.28 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58224)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/75?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the September milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Symbolic links support when opening folder

For a long time, VS Code has been resolving a symbolic link to a folder when opening. This meant, that even though the symbolic link was there for a reason, VS Code was ignoring it and always opened the resolved link path. We now have decided to change this behavior and preserve the symbolic link.

**Note:** Certain features will work with reduced functionality when opening a folder as a symbolic link (for example [debug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/57954) and [Git](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5970)).

### File icons per file type

On macOS and Windows, VS Code registers as the default editor for well-known file types. VS Code now ships custom icons for the some of the common VS Code file types. These icons will show up in the OS explorer when the size of the icons is configured to be medium to large. For small icon sizes, we decided to preserve the VS Code logo as the icon.

### Toggle panel changes

We decided to revisit the behavior of our commands for toggling panels (Terminal, Output, Problems, Debug Console). You can follow [issue 19400](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19400) for the background on the change.

The **old** behavior was:

* Panel shows if not visible.
* Panel hides if visible.

The **new** behavior is:

* Panel shows if not visible.
* Panel hides if having keyboard focus.
* Panel gets focused when visible but not focused.

To get back the previous behavior, you can configure a keybinding to close the panel when the related panel is active.

For example, for Output panel:

```json
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+u",
    "command": "workbench.action.closePanel",
    "when": "activePanel==workbench.panel.output"
}
```

The list of panel identifiers is:

* `workbench.panel.terminal`
* `workbench.panel.markers`
* `workbench.panel.output`
* `workbench.panel.repl`

### Copy Relative Path

The command to copy a file path as relative path is now more prominently exposed in the context menus of the File Explorer as well as editor tabs.

### Exclude recently opened files from Quick Open

A new setting `search.quickOpen.includeHistory` allows you to control if files that were recently opened should be part of the Quick Open file picker. By default, files that were recently opened will appear to the top of the search and other files from the workspace below. If you would prefer to not see recently opened files on top, you can change this setting to `false`.

### Disable trash when deleting files

If you are seeing issues when deleting files from the Explorer by moving them to the OS trash, you can now set `files.enableTrash` to `false` to never use the OS trash when deleting. Doing so will change the **Delete** action and keybinding on the File Explorer to bypass the OS trash and delete permanently. You will still see a prompt before the delete happens.

### Prompt to open workspace file if detected

When opening a folder that contains one or more `.code-workspace` files in the root, VS Code now shows a notification to ask if you'd like to open the workspace file instead. Opening a workspace file will usually provide a much better experience than just opening the folder. You can learn more about multi-root workspaces in our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).

### New setting to not restore view state when reopening a file

VS Code has always remembered the view state (cursor location, folding, etc.) of a file even after the file was closed. There is now a new setting `workbench.editor.restoreViewState` to drop this view state when a file is closed. This allows you to always start at the top of the file after reopening it.

### New command to close a file across all editor groups

A new command **Close Editor in all Groups** (`workbench.action.closeEditorInAllGroups`) allows you to close the currently active file across all editor groups.

## Editor

### Navigate to last edit location

A new command **Go to Last Edit Location** (`workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation`) was added to quickly navigate to the last location in a file that was edited. The default keybinding is `kb(workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation)`.

### Save without formatters

The new command **Save without Formatting** (`workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting`) can be used to save a file without triggering any of the save participants (for example, formatters, remove trailing whitespace, final newline). The default keybinding is `kb(workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting)`.

### Restrict encodings from being guessed

The new setting `files.guessableEncodings` can be used in combination with `files.autoGuessEncoding` to reduce the chance of a wrongly guessed encoding. If configured, only encodings from the list of `files.guessableEncodings` can be guessed. If the guessed encoding is not in the list, the default configured encoding will be used (via `files.encoding`).

## Extension Authoring

### New theme colors

There are new theme colors:

* `menu.separatorBackground`: Color of a separator menu item in menus.
* `sideBarSectionHeader.border`: Side bar section header border color.
* `inputValidation.infoForeground`: Input validation foreground color for information severity.
* `inputValidation.warningForeground`: Input validation foreground color for warning severity.
* `inputValidation.errorForeground`: Input validation foreground color for error severity.

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Debug API

**new `DebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugAdapter` replaces `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` commands**

Some time ago we added the proposed API `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` so that an extension can return a dynamically calculated path (and corresponding program arguments) for the debug adapter about to be launched by VS Code. In this milestone, we are revising the initial design based on the feedback received (for example [#45220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45220), [#56646](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/56646), [#57706](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/57706), [#54465](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/54465)).

The [new API method](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/513025ed9e97c2fc04721d435bd88e5b4a2269ad/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L536-L558) is called `provideDebugAdapter` and now we pass in the debug session, the workspace folder, the executable information from the `package.json`, and the resolved launch config. With this information, an extension has the "full picture" when being asked for creating the debug adapter.

In addition, we are now supporting more ways for starting and connecting to the debug adapter implementation. For this, a descriptor object can be returned from the `provideDebugAdapter` method:

* A `DebugAdapterExecutable` descriptor can be used to launch the debug adapter as an external process per session and communicates with it via stdin/stdout. With the new API, it is now possible to specify the working directory and environment variables for the debug adapter.
* A `DebugAdapterServer` describes a server process that handles multiple sessions and communicates via a socket.
* A `DebugAdapterImplementation` can be used for an in-place implementation that induces no communication overhead. This option relies on a small modification to the [Node.js based client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-debugadapter) for DAP and is planned for October.

Please note that this is proposed API and cannot be used in extensions published on the Marketplace. However, we'd appreciate your feedback for `DebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugAdapter` on issue [#45220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45220).

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation)`|Navigate to the last location edited|`workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation`
`kb(workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting)`|Save file without running save participants (formatters, etc.)|`workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting`
`kb(workbench.action.closeEditorInAllGroups)`|Close the active file across all editor groups|`workbench.action.closeEditorInAllGroups`

## Miscellaneous

### Electron update

In this release, we updated from Electron 2.0.7 to 2.0.9. Most notably this allows VS Code to run again on ArchLinux ([issue 55934](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55934)).

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Continued Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we continued to explore bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in the near future to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).
