## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.28 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58224)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/75?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the September milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Extension Authoring

### New theme colors

There are new theme colors:

* `menu.separatorBackground`: Color of a separator menu item in menus.
* `sideBarSectionHeader.border`: Side bar section header border color.
* `inputValidation.infoForeground`: Input validation foreground color for information severity.
* `inputValidation.warningForeground`: Input validation foreground color for warning severity.
* `inputValidation.errorForeground`: Input validation foreground color for error severity.

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Debug API

**new `DebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugAdapter` replaces `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` commands**

Some time ago we've added the proposed API `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` so that an extension can return a dynamically calculated path (and corresponding program arguments) for the debug adapter about to be launched by VS Code. In this milestone we are revising the initial design based on the feedback received (e.g. [#45220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45220), [#56646](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/56646), [#57706](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/57706), [#54465](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/54465)).

The [new API method](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/513025ed9e97c2fc04721d435bd88e5b4a2269ad/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L536-L558) is called `provideDebugAdapter` and now we pass in the debug session, the workspace folder, the executable information from the package.json, and the resolved launch config.
With this information an extension has the "full picture" when being asked for creating the debug adapter.

In addition we are now supporting more ways for starting and connecting to the debug adapter implementation. For this a descriptor object can be returned from the `provideDebugAdapter` method:
- a `DebugAdapterExecutable` descriptor can be used to launch the debug adapter as an external process per session and communicates with it via stdin/stdout. With the new API it is now possible to specify the working directory and environment variables for the debug adapter.
- a `DebugAdapterServer` describes a server process that handles multiple sessions and communicates via a socket,
- a `DebugAdapterImplementation` can be used for an in-place implementation that induces no communication overhead. This option relies on a small modification to the [node.js based client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-debugadapter) for DAP and is planned for October.

Please note that this is proposed API that you cannot use for extensions published on the Marketplace. But we'd appreciate feedback for `DebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugAdapter` on issue [#45220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45220).

## Miscellaneous

### Electron update

In this release, we updated from Electron 2.0.7 to 2.0.9. Most notably this allows VSCode to run again on ArchLinux ([issue 55934](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55934)).

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Continued Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we continued  explored bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in the near future to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Notable Fixes

* [58327](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58327): Debug toolbar buttons disabled
* [35935](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35935): "Clear Recently Opened" should also clear editor quick pick history
* [58799](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58799): Reveal unitled file when saving
* [29553](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29553): Preserve quick open input on Escape
