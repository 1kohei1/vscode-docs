## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.26 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53850)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/72?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the July milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Breadcrumbs 🥖 🍞

The editor now has a navigation bar above its contents - we call it **Breadcrumbs**. It shows the current location and allows you to quickly navigate between symbols and files. To start using breadcrumbs, enable it with the **View** > **Toggle Breadcrumbs** command or via the `breadcrumbs.enabled` setting.

When using editor [tabs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_tabs) (default), breadcrumbs are displayed in a separate row below the editor title. If you are [not using](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_working-without-tabs) editor tabs, breadcrumbs show as an interactive file path next to the title.

![Breadcrumbs Enable](images/1_26/breadcrumbs_tabs_notabs.png)

Breadcrumbs always show the file path and, with the help of extensions, the symbol path up to the cursor position. The symbols shown are the same as in Outline view and Go to Symbol and so existing extensions will just work with breadcrumbs.

The appearance of breadcrumbs can be customized. If you have very long paths or are only interested in either file paths or symbols paths, you can use the `breadcrumbs.filePath` and `breadcrumbs.symbolPath` settings. Both support `on`, `off`, and `last` and they define if or what part of the path you see.

To interact with breadcrumbs, use the **Focus Breadcrumbs** command or press `kb(breadcrumbs.focusAndSelect)`. It will select that last element and open a dropdown that allows you to navigate to a sibling file or symbol. Use the `kb(breadcrumbs.focusPrevious)` and `kb(breadcrumbs.focusNext)` keyboard shortcuts to go to elements before or after the current element. When the dropdown appears, simply start typing - all matching elements will be highlighted and the best match will be selected so that it can be navigated to quickly.

![Breadcrumbs Enable](images/1_26/breadcrumbs_active.gif)

You can also interact with breadcrumbs without the picker. Press `kb(breadcrumbs.focus)` to focus the last element, use `kb(breadcrumbs.focusPrevious)` and `kb(breadcrumbs.focusNext)` to navigate, and use `kb(breadcrumbs.revealFocused)` to reveal the element in the editor.

### Grid: Automated maximize of minimized editors

One feature we lost during the introduction of the grid editor layout last milestone was the ability to have editors automatically maximize when you focus them and they are in their minimized state. This feature is now working as before:

![Grid Maximize](images/1_26/grid-maximize.gif)

**Note:** You can always maximize the active editor via **View: Maximize Editor Group** (`workbench.action.minimizeOtherEditors`) or reset all editor sizes via **View: Reset Editor Group Sizes** (`workbench.action.evenEditorWidths`).

### View menu cleanup

The **View** menu was growing very large and we decided to move many of the entries into a separate **Appearance** sub-menu to clean it up.

![View Menu](images/1_26/appearance.png)

### Copy Relative Path

VS Code always had an action to copy the absolute path of a file to the clipboard (`kb(copyFilePath)`). There is now a new action **Copy Relative Path** (`kb(copyRelativeFilePath)`) to copy the file path relative to the workspace folder root.

**Note:** You can get to this action from the context menu (for example, on a tab or a file in the File Explorer) by pressing and holding the `Shift` key (`Alt` key on macOS) before opening the menu.

### Problems view: Quick Fixes

You can now apply Quick Fixes from the Problems view. A light bulb indicating Quick Fixes is shown when you hover or select a problem entry. Quick Fixes can be applied by clicking on the light bulb or by opening the context menu for the problem entry.

![Quick fixes](images/1_26/quickfix-problems.gif)

**Note:** Light bulb indicator is shown only if the extension contributing Quick Fixes provides [Diagnostic](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/1.26.0/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2029) information associated with the Quick Fix.

### Custom view: File resource decorations

Custom views showing file resources will now have file decorations (git, problems) shown. You can disable them using the settings `explorer.decorations.colors` and `explorer.decorations.badges` which disables them in File Explorer, Open Editors and Custom views.

![Custom view decorations](images/1_26/customview-decorations.png)

### Run npm scripts from package.json

You can now run an npm script in a `package.json` file from the hover as shown below or from the context menu.

![npm script hover](images/1_26/npm-script-hover.png)

### Opening folder URIs

You can now open an URI as a folder in VS Code, if there is an extension contributing a `FileSystemProvider` for that URI. We introduced a new command line argument `--folder-uri` to do this.

The following CLI command opens the VS Code GitHub repository as a folder, if you have [RemoteHub](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.remotehub) extension installed.

`code --folder-uri remotehub://github.com/Microsoft/vscode`

![Open Folder URI](images/1_26/open-folder-uri.png)

### Rapid render

On startup, the basic workbench layout is now restored much faster. First, the Activity Bar, Side Bar, and Status Bar are restored, followed by headers and icons, and then the Explorer and editor region are populated.

![Rapid Render](images/1_26/rapid_render.gif)

Rapid render is meant to improve perceived performance as the time you are looking at an empty canvas is reduced. We have more ideas how to extend this and we are interested in your feedback.

### Accessibility improvements

We have fixed a large number of accessibility issues - mostly around keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast etc. The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22July+2018%22+is%3Aclosed).

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.0

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 3.0.1. This major update brings support for project references, better support for tuples, and other language and tooling features. You can read more about TypeScript 3.0 [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/07/30/announcing-typescript-3-0/).

### Better error reporting for JavaScript and TypeScript

The TypeScript team has done a lot of work to make error messages smarter and clearer. Some error messages now include links to relevant locations in the source code.

![Related locations showing in a diagnostic. Clicking on 'box.ts' will show the definition of 'width' in 'box'](images/1_26/ts-related-diagnostic.png)

Messages for unions and other complex types should also be more concise and helpful. For example, a simple type error in JSX could sometimes produce a complex error message like this:

![How this simple type error used to be reported by TypeScript 2.8](images/1_26/ts-28-bad-error.png)

Thanks to TypeScript 3.0, the error is much more readable in VS Code 1.26:

![How the error is now reported](images/1_26/ts-30-better-error.png)

### JSX tag completion

JSX tags are now closed automatically when you type `>` in a JavaScript or TypeScript file:

![Tag completion of jsx tags](images/1_26/ts-jsx-tag-complete.gif)

This matches what VS Code already provided in HTML files. Auto closing of tags can be disabled by setting `"javascript.autoClosingTags": false` and `"typescript.autoClosingTags": false`.

### Add all missing imports Quick Fix for JavaScript and TypeScript

The **Add missing import** Quick Fix can now be applied to all missing imports in a file:

![Adding multiple missing imports with a single quick fix](images/1_26/ts-import-all-quick-fix.gif)

This Quick Fix will only add imports for symbols with a single potential definition. If there are multiple potential definitions of a symbol in the current project, for example having two different files export a symbol called `Button`, you must Quick Fix the individual error and select the specific import that you intended.

To use this Quick Fix in JavaScript files, [enable semantic checking](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript#_type-checkin).

### JSX Folding

JSX tags are now foldable when using [syntax aware folding](/docs/editor/codebasics.md#folding).

![Folding JSX tags](images/1_26/ts-jsx-folding.gif)

### Convert between named imports and namespace imports

Two new refactorings let you quickly convert between named imports and namespace imports in JavaScript and TypeScript:

![Folding jsx tags](images/1_26/ts-convert-to-namespace-import.gif)

### Clickable links in jsconfig.json and tsconfig.json project files

Quickly navigate `jsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.json` project references by `Cmd` clicking on project reference paths:

![Cmd click on the path to open the referenced project's tsconfig](images/1_26/ts-tsconfig-path-click.png)

The [`extends`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) path is now also clickable.

## Debugging

### Improved stop debug behavior

In previous releases, the **Debug: Stop** action (found on the Debug toolbar) would always kill a debuggee and its child processes immediately, without giving the debuggee a chance to clean up gracefully. Some users didn't like this behavior because they were forced to do manual cleanup after stopping a debug session.

In this release, we've improved the **Debug: Stop** action in the following way, when pressing **Stop** for the first time, the debuggee is no longer killed immediately but it is requested to shutdown gracefully (and to clean up everything as necessary).

If there are no breakpoints (or problems) in that shutdown code, the debuggee and the debug session will terminate. The user will not not see any difference in behavior to previous versions of VS Code. However, if the debugger hits a breakpoint in the shutdown code or if the debuggee does not terminate properly by itself, then the debug session will not end. In this case, pressing the **Stop** button again will force terminate the debuggee. So if you see that a debug session doesn't end when you press the red **Stop** button, then press the button again to force a shutdown of the debuggee.

Note: This feature is only supported by debugger extensions that have opted into implementing it. Currently this is the case for the built-in Node.js debugger. We expect other debug extensions to support this feature soon.

### Changed smartStep behavior for Node/Chrome debugging

Previously, `"smartStep": true` would cause the Node.js debugger to not stop in source code without source maps. This can happen in two ways: files don't have source maps at all (source code that isn't transpiled or .js files shipped with node modules) and, in transpiled files that do have source maps, but there are individual lines that aren't mapped (extra lines that TypeScript inserts when down compiling some features like async/await).

With VS Code 1.26, `"smartStep": true` will only affect the second type, lines that are missing from a source map. Now you'll be able to step into .js files while still skipping TS async/await code that nobody wants to step through.

We changed this because we realized that the old smartStep behavior was too aggressive. Skipping the second type of code is usually a no-brainer. But skipping in the first scenario only makes sense in some projects or for some users. And the `skipFiles` option does a better job of covering the case for entire files, since it can target files more precisely and is faster.

So, if you are using `smartStep` and notice that the debugger is no longer auto-skipping through files without source maps, you can use `skipFiles` to get the previous behavior back. See the [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_skipping-uninteresting-code-node-chrome) for examples of how to configure _skipFiles_ to skip code in node_modules, internal node files, or any other files that you don't want to step through.

## Extensions

### Extension Pack management

Extension Pack management has become a lot smoother in this release. An Extension Pack is installed, uninstalled, enabled or disabled always as a pack. You can also now uninstall or disable an extension belonging to an Extension Pack without requiring you to uninstall or disable the entire Extension Pack.

There is also a new **Extension Pack** tab when you open extension details.

![Extension Pack](images/1_26/extension-pack.png)

**Note:** This needs adoption by Extension Packs. See [Extension Packs revisited](#extension-packs-revisited) for more details.

### Disabling extensions from command line

You can now disable extensions from the command line using the new argument `--disable-extension`.

* `code <folder_path> --disable-extension ms-python.python` - Opens the folder with `ms-python.python` extension disabled.c
* `code <folder_path> --disable-extension ms-python.python --disable-extension ms-vscode.csharp` - Opens the folder with `ms-python.python` and `ms-vscode.csharp` extensions disabled.

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### New Settings Editor

In this milestone, we continued work on a GUI for editing settings. It's still a preview, but if you'd like to try it out, you can open it with the **Preferences: Open Settings (Preview)** command. We would like to hear any feedback you have - you can leave it on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/50249).

![New Settings Editor](images/1_26/settings-editor.png)

Some of the new changes compared to last month are:

* The header UX has been refreshed and cleaned up, and the actions to only show modified settings and to open the JSON editor have been moved under the `...` menu to the right.
* The table of contents on the left is now collapsed by default, and expands as you scroll to reveal the current section.
* Setting descriptions are now rendered as markdown. Some settings have external links to relevant docs, and references to other settings are now clickable links that scroll to the setting. The `enumDescriptions` of enum-type settings are now shown after the setting description (and in the JSON editor as well):

![setting links and markdown](images/1_26/autosave.png)

* A new control for the `files.exclude` and `search.exclude` settings makes it easier to add or remove glob patterns, and to see which ones are applied for the current scope:

![new exclude control](images/1_26/exclude.png)

* The controls in the settings editor are now themeable. See the new theme colors under [New theme colors](#new-theme-colors).

## Extension Authoring

### Extension Packs revisited

Defining an Extension Pack now uses a new property called `extensionPack` instead of `extensionDependencies` in `package.json`. This is because `extensionDependencies` is mainly used to define functional dependencies among extensions that prevents uninstalling or disabling an extension dependency without uninstalling or disabling the dependent extension.

An Extension Pack should not have any functional dependencies with its bundled extensions and they should be manageable independent of the pack. Below is an example `extensionPack` entry which defines an Extension Pack that bundles several debugger extensions.

```json
"extensionPack": [
    "andreweinand.mock-debug",
    "ms-vscode.mono-debug",
    "ms-vscode.cpptools",
    "ms-vscode.csharp",
    "vscjava.vscode-java-debug"
]
```

This will make managing extension pack and bundled extensions much simpler and better. See [Extension Pack Management](#extension-pack-management).

### Better Workspace Edit

The `WorkspaceEdit` and `applyEdit` APIs have been extended to allow extensions to create, rename, and delete files. Before, only textual edits were possible. The new APIs allow for better refactorings; for example, renaming a file when a class name is changed.

### New Theme colors

There are new theme colors for the breadcrumbs:

* `breadcrumb.breadcrumbsForeground`: Color of focused breadcrumb items.
* `breadcrumb.breadcrumbsFocusForeground`: Color of focused breadcrumb items.
* `breadcrumb.breadcrumbsActiveSelectionForeground`: Color of selected breadcrumb items.
* `breadcrumb.breadcrumbsPickerBackground`: Background color of breadcrumb item picker.

The controls of the new settings editor are now themeable:

- `settings.headerForeground`: The foreground color for a section header or active title.
- `settings.modifiedItemForeground`: The foreground color for a the modified setting indicator.
- `settings.inactiveSelectedItemBorder`: The color of the selected setting row border, when the settings list does not have focus.
- `settings.dropdownBackground`: Dropdown background.
- `settings.dropdownForeground`: Dropdown foreground.
- `settings.dropdownBorder`: Dropdown border.
- `settings.checkboxBackground`: Checkbox background.
- `settings.checkboxForeground`: Checkbox foreground.
- `settings.checkboxBorder`: Checkbox border.
- `settings.textInputBackground`: Text input box background.
- `settings.textInputForeground`: Text input box foreground.
- `settings.textInputBorder`: Text input box border.
- `settings.numberInputBackground`: Number input box background.
- `settings.numberInputForeground`: Number input box foreground.
- `settings.numberInputBorder`: Number input box border.

### DefinitionLink

Definition providers may now return a `DefinitionLink` object. Definition links provide additional metadata over normal [location](#Location) definitions, including the range of the defining symbol:

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    vscode.languages.registerDefinitionProvider('markdown', new LineLinkDefinitionProvider());
}

export class LineLinkDefinitionProvider implements vscode.DefinitionProvider {
    async provideDefinition(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): Promise<vscode.DefinitionLink[]> {
        const wordRange = document.getWordRangeAtPosition(position, /<\d+>/);
        if (wordRange.isEmpty) {
            return [];
        }

        const targetLine = +document.getText(wordRange).slice(1, -1);
        return [{
            // Definition location
            targetRange: new vscode.Range(targetLine - 1, 0, targetLine, 0),
            targetUri: document.uri,

            // Range of the defining symbol
            originSelectionRange: new vscode.Range(
                wordRange.start.translate({ characterDelta: 1 }),
                wordRange.end.translate({ characterDelta: -1 })),
        }];
    }
}
```

### Debug Extensions

**New `terminate` request for Debug Adapter Protocol**

A new `terminate` request and a corresponding `supportsTerminateRequest` capability have been added to the _Debug Adapter Protocol_ in order to support the graceful shutdown of debuggees from [explained above](#improved-stop-debug-behavior).
If a debug adapter returns `true` for the `supportsTerminateRequest` capability, VS Code will first send a `terminate` request to the debug adapter when it stops a debug session.
The implementation of the `terminate` request in the debug adapter should request the debuggee to terminate itself.
On Unix-based operating systems this could easily be achieved by sending the `SIGINT` signal to the debuggee.

### Webview icons

[Webviews](/https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/webview) may now provide a custom icon that is shown in the tab bar and opened editors view:

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as path from 'path';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {

    context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('catCoding.start', () => {
        const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel('catCoding',
            "Coding Cat", vscode.ViewColumn.One, { });

        panel.iconPath = vscode.Uri.file(path.join(context.extensionPath, 'media', 'cat.png'));
    });
}
```

![A webview with a custom icon](images/1_26/webview-icon.png)

### TextSearchProvider, FileSearchProvider, FileIndexProvider

We've added a set of API that let extensions implement text search and file search in VS Code.

`TextSearchProvider` is invoked when a user uses the search viewlet or when an extension uses the new API `workspace.findTextInFiles`. It returns text matches incrementally through the `progress` callback.

There are two ways to implement file search, covering the two common use-cases we anticipate. A `FileIndexProvider` is invoked once when the user opens Quick Open, and must return an array of every file in the workspace. VS Code then searches within this list and applies its own fuzzy-matching logic to return the correct set of results to the user. If your extension is capable of providing a listing of every file in the workspace, then implementing a `FileIndexProvider` is the easier way to support file search.

If your extension needs to handle the user's search query and return its own list of filtered results, implement a `FileSearchProvider`. It's invoked on the user's every keypress in Quick Open, and must return a filtered and sorted set of file matches.

```ts
export interface TextSearchProvider {
    provideTextSearchResults(query: TextSearchQuery, options: TextSearchOptions, progress: Progress<TextSearchResult>, token: CancellationToken): Thenable<void>;
}

export interface FileIndexProvider {
    provideFileIndex(options: FileIndexOptions, token: CancellationToken): Thenable<Uri[]>;
}

export interface FileSearchProvider {
    provideFileSearchResults(query: FileSearchQuery, options: FileSearchOptions, token: CancellationToken): Thenable<Uri[]>;
}

export namespace workspace {
    export function registerTextSearchProvider(scheme: string, provider: TextSearchProvider): Disposable;
    export function registerFileIndexProvider(scheme: string, provider: FileIndexProvider): Disposable;
    export function registerFileSearchProvider(scheme: string, provider: FileSearchProvider): Disposable;
}
```

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedAPI": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Notable Changes

* [53532](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53532): Editor: load changes to file in the background if file already loaded
* [53586](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53586): Node debug: auto attach mode is not remembered
* [53022](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53022): "Read-only" label in the editor tabs for files that are read only
* [48275](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/48275) `resourceIsFile` context key is no longer supported
