## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.26 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53850)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/72?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the July milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Grid: Automated maximize of minimized editors

One feature we lost during the introduction of the grid editor layout last milestone was the ability to have editors automatically maximize when you focus them and they are in their minimized state. This feature is now working as before:

![Grid Maximize](images/1_26/grid-maximize.gif)

**Note:** You can always maximize the active editor via `kb(workbench.action.minimizeOtherEditors)` or reset all editor sizes via `kb(workbench.action.evenEditorWidths)`.

### View menu cleanup

The **View** menu was growing very large and we decided to move many of the entries into a separate **Appearance** sub-menu to clean it up.

### Copy Relative Path

VS Code always had an action to copy the absolute path of a file to the clipboard (`kb(copyFilePath)`). There is now a new action **Copy Relative Path** (`kb(copyRelativeFilePath)`) to copy the file path relative to the workspace folder root.

**Note:** You can get to this action from the context menu (for example, on a tab or a file in the File Explorer) by pressing and holding the `Shift` key (`Alt` key on macOS) before opening the menu.

## Extension Authoring

### Better Workspace Edit

The `WorkspaceEdit` and `applyEdit`-APIs have been extended to allow to create, rename, and delete files. Before, only textual edits were possible. The new API allows for better refactorings, e.g. rename a file when a class name is being changed.

## Notable Changes

* [53532](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53532): Editor: load changes to file in the background if file already loaded
